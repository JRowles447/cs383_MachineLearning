# cs383_MachineLearning 

Homework assignment \#6 for Artificial Intelligence course. Includes programs for linear and logistic regression, k-means, and bayesian learning (also includes decision tree, but not yet implemented). All programs produce figures that can be located in `/figures`. Linear regression runs on set data, logistic regression operates on random data, k-means runs on random points with randomly initialized centroids. 

## Running the Programs
### Running Linear Regression
Run Linear Regression with the following command:    
`>python linearRegression.py`   
Program approximates weight function through multiple iterations of gradient descent. Calculates the closed form solution through the utilization of the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse. Output includes the difference between the approximate and analytic calculations and both weight vectors. 

### Running Logistic Regression
### Running kmean
### Running Bayesian Learning
