Homework assignment \#6 for Artificial Intelligence course. Includes programs for linear and logistic regression, k-means, and bayesian learning (also includes decision tree, but not yet implemented). All programs produce figures that can be located in `/figures`. Linear regression runs on set data, logistic regression operates on random data, k-means runs on random points with randomly initialized centroids.
